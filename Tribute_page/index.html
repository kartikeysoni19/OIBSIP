  <p>Chandra Shekhar Azad, born on July 23, 1906, was one of the prominent Indian freedom fighters who played a significant role in the country's struggle for independence against British rule. He was a fearless revolutionary who dedicated his life to the cause of freedom.</p>

  <p>Azad was a charismatic leader and a brilliant strategist. He was deeply inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and his non-violent methods but felt that armed resistance was necessary to overthrow the British Raj. He believed in the power of youth and formed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) to fight for an independent India.</p>

  <p>Chandra Shekhar Azad's determination and courage were unwavering. He took part in several revolutionary activities, including the Kakori train robbery in 1925, where he and his comrades looted a British train to fund their movement. Azad's quick thinking and exceptional marksmanship earned him the nickname "Azad," meaning "free" in Hindi.</p>

  <p>He was relentless in his pursuit of freedom and became a symbol of resistance against colonial oppression. Azad's hideouts, including the famous Alfred Park in Allahabad, became sites of inspiration for many freedom fighters.</p>

  <p>In the face of immense pressure from the British police, Chandra Shekhar Azad remained steadfast and refused to surrender. On February 27, 1931, he fought valiantly against the British forces in Alfred Park, where he sacrificed his life to uphold the principles of liberty.</p>

  <p>Chandra Shekhar Azad's legacy continues to inspire generations. His unwavering spirit, selflessness, and sacrifice remind us of the price that was paid for India's freedom. He remains an icon of bravery and patriotism, etched in the annals of Indian history.After the suspension of the non-cooperation movement in 1922 by Mahatma Gandhi, Azad became disappointed. He met a young revolutionary, Manmath Nath Gupta, who introduced him to Ram Prasad Bismil who had formed the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), a revolutionary organization. He then became an active member of the HRA and started to collect funds for HRA. Most of the fund collection was through robberies of government property. He was involved in the Kakori Train Robbery of 1925, the shooting of John P. Saunders at Lahore in 1928 to avenge the killing of Lala Lajpat Rai, and at last, in the attempt to blow up the Viceroy of India's train in 1929.

    Azad got to read the Communist Manifesto from his comrade Shiv Verma. When Azad was the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary party, he often use to borrow a book called ABC of Communism from writer Satyabhakta to teach socialism to his cadres.</p>

  <p>Let us remember and pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of Chandra Shekhar Azad, a true hero who fought fearlessly for the freedom we enjoy today.</p>
